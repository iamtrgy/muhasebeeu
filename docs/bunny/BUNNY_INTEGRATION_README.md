# Bunny CDN Storage Integration

This document provides information about the integration of Bunny CDN Storage with our Laravel application.

## Overview

We've successfully integrated Bunny CDN's Storage API for file storage in our Laravel application. The integration uses a custom `BunnyAdapter` that implements the League Flysystem `FilesystemAdapter` interface, allowing seamless integration with Laravel's Storage system.

## Key Components

1. **BunnyAdapter** (`app/Services/BunnyAdapter.php`): A custom adapter that handles the communication with Bunny CDN's Storage API.

2. **BunnyStorageServiceProvider** (`app/Providers/BunnyStorageServiceProvider.php`): A service provider that registers the Bunny CDN storage driver with Laravel's filesystem.

3. **Filesystem Configuration** (`config/filesystems.php`): Contains the configuration for the Bunny CDN storage, including API key, storage zone name, region, and other settings.

## Troubleshooting Fixes Applied

We resolved several issues with the Bunny CDN integration:

1. **Authentication Issues**: The original implementation was having issues with authentication (401 Unauthorized errors). We updated the request headers to include the `AccessKey` header with the API key for proper authentication.

2. **File Existence Checking**: The `fileExists` method was using a `HEAD` request which was causing authentication issues with Bunny's Storage API. We changed it to use a `GET` request with a `Range` header to retrieve only the first byte of the file, which is more reliable.

3. **Directory Existence Checking**: We improved the `directoryExists` method to better handle API responses and ensure it correctly identifies directories.

4. **Error Handling**: We enhanced error handling throughout the adapter to provide more detailed information in case of failures.

## Testing

We've created the following test scripts to verify the integration:

1. **bunny_updated_test.php**: Tests the `BunnyAdapter` directly for basic file operations (upload, read, check existence, delete).

2. **bunny_laravel_test.php**: Tests the integration with Laravel's Storage facade.

Both tests confirm that the Bunny CDN Storage integration is now working correctly.

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Move Configuration to .env**: Consider moving sensitive information like the API key to the `.env` file and updating the `filesystems.php` configuration to use environment variables.

2. **URL Generation Method**: Implement a `url` method in the `BunnyAdapter` that generates URLs for stored files using the configured URL pattern.

3. **Additional Features**: Consider implementing additional features like `temporaryUrl`, `checksum`, `size`, etc. for more advanced file operations.

4. **Caching**: Implement caching for file existence checks and metadata to improve performance.

## Usage Example

```php
// Upload a file
Storage::disk('bunny')->put('path/to/file.txt', 'File contents');

// Check if a file exists
if (Storage::disk('bunny')->exists('path/to/file.txt')) {
    // File exists
}

// Read a file
$contents = Storage::disk('bunny')->get('path/to/file.txt');

// Delete a file
Storage::disk('bunny')->delete('path/to/file.txt');
```
