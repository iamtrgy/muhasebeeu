# Component Migration Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks the migration progress of UI components across all views in the application. It serves as a central reference to know what has been changed and what remains to be done.

## Component Mapping Reference

| Old Component | New Component | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| `<x-primary-button>` | `<x-ui.button.primary>` | Legacy wrapper exists |
| `<x-secondary-button>` | `<x-ui.button.secondary>` | Legacy wrapper exists |
| `<x-danger-button>` | `<x-ui.button.danger>` | Legacy wrapper exists |
| `<x-modal>` | `<x-ui.modal.base>` | Different API, needs migration |
| `<x-input-label>` | Built into `<x-ui.form.input>` | Label prop |
| `<x-text-input>` | `<x-ui.form.input>` | Complete replacement |
| `<x-input-error>` | Built into `<x-ui.form.input>` | Error prop |
| `<table>` | `<x-ui.table.base>` | Complete structure change |
| `<div class="alert">` | `<x-ui.alert>` | New component |

## Files Modified During Migration

### Phase 1 (Foundation)
1. Created all new UI components under `/resources/views/components/ui/`
2. Created showcase page at `/resources/views/ui-showcase.blade.php`
3. Modified legacy wrappers to use new components

### Phase 2 (Component Development)
1. Fixed button type issues in primary-button wrapper
2. Fixed modal functionality issues
3. Created comprehensive form component library
4. Added advanced components (tooltips, spinners, etc.)

### Phase 3 (Integration) - IN PROGRESS
1. ✅ `/resources/views/auth/login.blade.php` - Form components migrated
2. ✅ `/resources/views/auth/register.blade.php` - Form components migrated
3. ⚠️ `/resources/views/admin/profile/partials/update-profile-information-form.blade.php` - Partially migrated
4. ✅ `/resources/views/admin/profile/partials/delete-user-form.blade.php` - Modal and form migrated
5. ✅ `/resources/views/user/companies/index.blade.php` - Table, alerts, and tooltips migrated

## Tracking Method

### Git Commits
Each migration should be committed separately with clear messages:
```bash
git add [file]
git commit -m "Migrate [component type] in [file path]"
```

### Testing Checklist for Each File
- [ ] Visual appearance matches original
- [ ] Dark mode working
- [ ] Responsive design intact
- [ ] JavaScript functionality working
- [ ] Form validation working (if applicable)
- [ ] Accessibility maintained

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Find all instances of old components
grep -r "x-primary-button" resources/views/
grep -r "x-secondary-button" resources/views/
grep -r "x-danger-button" resources/views/
grep -r "x-modal" resources/views/
grep -r "x-text-input" resources/views/
grep -r "x-input-label" resources/views/
grep -r "x-input-error" resources/views/
grep -r "<table" resources/views/
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete comprehensive scan of all views
2. Create detailed migration plan for each component type
3. Migrate files in priority order (auth → user → admin)
4. Test each migration thoroughly
5. Remove legacy components after full migration

## Notes

- Always check IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for overall strategy
- Reference VIEW_STRUCTURE_CLEANUP_PLAN.md before modifying files
- Update this tracker after each file migration
- Commit changes incrementally for easy rollback
